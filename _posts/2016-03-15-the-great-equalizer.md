As of March 1st, every single\[1\] (eligible) team in Division 1 Men's and Women's basketball had a chance at the national championship. 1 month of single-elimination basketball--where up to 68 teams get a second chance-- to determine the national champion. It is a phenomenal event for any number of reasons. 

# The Great Equalizer

I'm a Kansas Jayhawk fan. I always have been. Every season I write their name under "champion" in my bracket and work backwards from there. I don't care about anything else. All over, there are other, people working in the same way. There are also folks who look at who the best teams are and slot them right in. This year, the number one overall seed, and the Jayhawks happen to be the same team. A lot of people have the Jayhawks written under champion. Vegas even projects them to be the team with the best chance of winning the tournament. 

The perception that they are the best team, and the numbers that back them up, don't really mean anything. Once the bracket is set, all any team can do is win six (or seven) straight games. One consequence of this is that even though Kansas is the most-likely team to win the tournament, it is relatively unlikely to happen. Vegas, and other number folks have anywhere between 14 and 19% chance that they cut down the nets. Their 30-4 record does little for them now except put some marginally worse teams in their path than others might have, but in a week, that is unlikely to matter at all. 

# The Buzz

March Madness could easily refer to the folks who come out of the woodwork in late February/early March and start filling out brackets and becoming prognosticators. So many people do this. Office pools, online tournament challenges, reams of printed brackets are the norm for the week after selection Sunday, and conversation about it can hardly be avoided. No other sporting event does this. Even in the S(EC)outh, the level of interest in college basketball during this week surpasses anything that I've observed at any other time of year. This interest is cross-sectional and wide-spread. 

The stories that the tournament produces are fantastic. Team stories like Florida Gulf Coast in 2013 (Dunk City) and personal narratives about the athlete-students emerge and are highlighted throughout the event, and people care about those things. We care about them over time, and it becomes a Big Deal to us.  

# Shining Moments

Moving past the preamble and extra-basketball stuff, the tournament is great at producing the moments that make watching sports fun. The big plays in high-leverage situations in a winner-take-all situation. The NBA, MLB, and NHL playoffs can't compete because of their "best of X" nature (though, I'll be the first to admit that Game 7s tend to be a better overall experience than about 64 of a tournament's 67 games. The Super Bowl and NFL playoffs occasionally produce those moments, but in small numbers. The World Cup is a bit more comparable, but only happens every four years. Every year, amazing things happen, and they usually happen multiple times a day. Over the first two rounds, there are 48 games in four days and spectacular moments are pervasive. For every David Tyree there's Ty Rogers and De'Jon Jackson buzzer-beating upset victory shots, Gerald Henderson and Darren Collison upset preventing layups, and Mario Chalmers  Nothing matches it.

# Imperfect

College basketball is great. 

College basketball is also big business. 

Each tournament game a team plays in is worth over a quarter a million dollars\[2\] paid to that team's conference every year for six years. It translates to $220M paid to conferences and distributed to colleges, and my guess is that there's another share of money that doesn't go back to our institutes of higher learning.  

Troubling for a lot of people is that none of that money goes directly to players. The debate is an interesting one. What is the athlete providing the school, what is the school providing the athlete, and what is the appropriate ratio for that relationship? How does that differ from schools like Kansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina, to schools like Austin Peay, Stony Brook, and Fairleigh Dickinson? 

There's also the athlete-student vs. student-athlete aspect to consider. Some folks idealize college basketball because of its purity and reject the notion of "one-and-dones." The NBA's rules have created a situation where players who would rather jump straight into the NBA after high school are forced to consider other options for a year after high school. In effect, the NBA has outsourced the development and risk assessment of its employees to the college level, which is basically what has happened in the broader professional world. And, as in that broader world, people are looking for alternatives. Brandon Jennings played basketball overseas for a year, but for most players, college programs provide the next logical step. All of this creates an environment where "college basketball" might not accurately describe what we are seeing. That rubs folks the wrong way. 

# 3...2...1...

Acknowledging sports as entertainment and business\[3\] has gone a long way towards enhancing my enjoyment of them (except in the case of professional football, where it has done the exact opposite). And in terms of excitement before the event and the density of entertainment during the event, nothing matches March Madness for me. 

\[1\] The Ivy League teams are the only ones for whom this might not be true, as they don't currently have an end-of-season conference  tournament, though next year the conference's [top four teams will battle it out for a bid][0]. 

\[2\] This year's "[share][1]" is valued at $260.5K for 2016 and and $291.7K when it "expires" in 2021\. 

\[3\] As opposed to something more idyllic?
