I was talking with my students today and one of them made the claim that _[The Force Awakens][0]_ was going to be the most important movie of all time. I eventually stared him down to "most important movie of our generation." I then told him I didn't think that it was going to be important, which started a discussion on what it meant for a movie to be important and what some important movies were. 

Eventually, and staying on theme, I said that _[A New Hope][1]_ was an important movie because it was a clear demarcation point in the history of movies: branding, world building, sci-fi, space epics. Many movies today are possible because of what _A New Hope _did as a movie. _The Wizard of Oz_ was a similar demarcation point in movie history. 

Historical perspective is also something that you need to have in order to make the claim that a movie is important. I may, in fact, be wrong about _The Force Awakens_, but even if it is as good as everyone hopes, and even if it spawns a renewed interest in the material and all of the attendant new movies that will happen because of it, that isn't anything really different from what Marvel has done recently.
